Airtable Local Backup
=====================

Introduction
============

Airtable Local Backup provides a (somewhat) user friendly way to backup data
from `Airtable <http://airtable.com>`_ locally. There are a number of useful
functions to generate your own custom backup scripts or you can use the
provided ``Runner`` class and a yaml-style configuration file
to orchestrate the backup.
